# SE-assignment2
Assignment 2 for CINS 5318 - Software Engineering. 

# Project Description: 
    An assignment, from Software Engineering Professor Dr. Mary Kim, to help students learn to use GitHub. GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaborative software development. In this assignment I worked both indivdually and with others in my group, utilizing GitHub's features to manage my code, track changes, collaborate with others, and document my work. 
    
# Installation Instructions: 
Checking for Git
    To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

    If you're on a Mac, look for a command prompt application called "Terminal".
    If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or "Git Bash".
Once you've opened your terminal application, type "git version". The output will either tell        you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that git is an unknown command. If     it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.
